# Hand Washing Timers

[You can find more info about this project in our ful writeup here](https://www.hackster.io/331510/wash-a-lot-bot-a-diy-hand-washing-timer-2df500?auth_token=cbc8bba25bd3d1f15c4e32ee9d3fe3dd)

Using proper hand-washing technique is one of the five things you can do right now to help keep yourself and others healthy. The CDC recommends washing for 20 seconds, so while stuck at home, we made this DIY hand washing timer to help nudge everyone in the right direction. We call it - the Wash-A-Lot-Bot!

This project is for people of all ages and skill-levels, and all the parts can be ordered from Adafruit, Sparkfun, or any electronics retailer for roughly $35.

Weâ€™re sharing our project to hopefully inspire other makers out there to come up with their own creative ideas to help fight the spread of COVID-19 in whatever ways they can.

Here are a few more Fritzing diagrams, bill of materials, and code for some more variations on the handwashing timers. Remix these and make them your own!

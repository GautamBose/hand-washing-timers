# Segment Display with IR distance sensor wash timer
This version of the hand wash timer uses a 14 segment display (so you can write a nice message upon completion). It also uses a very accurate IR distance sensor that will work very consistently, but it is quite expensive compared to a Ultra-Sonic distance sensor. Cheaper IR sensors could potentially be made to work with this version as well.
